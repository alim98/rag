Project Description
This project involves the development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot. The chatbot is designed to handle a variety of user queries by retrieving relevant documents from a specified source and generating detailed, contextually accurate responses. The chatbot is capable of processing queries related to Natural Language Processing (NLP), computer science topics, and even general knowledge. The system makes use of advanced machine learning and NLP techniques to retrieve, classify, and respond to queries efficiently and accurately.

Features
PDF and Web Document Retrieval: The system retrieves documents from a set of provided PDFs and specified web links. These documents are then processed and stored for easy retrieval when a query is posed.

Text Splitting and Chunking: Large documents are broken down into smaller, manageable chunks that allow for more efficient processing and context preservation. This enables the chatbot to maintain the relevance of information across larger datasets.

Embeddings and Vector Store: The chatbot uses embeddings to represent textual data as vectors in high-dimensional space. These embeddings are stored in a vector database, which allows for quick and accurate similarity searches when responding to queries.

Relevance Classification: The system classifies whether retrieved documents are relevant to the user's query, ensuring that only the most appropriate documents are used to generate responses.

Query Routing: Depending on the nature of the user query, the system intelligently routes it to the appropriate tool, such as a local document store or a web-based search engine, ensuring the most relevant source is used for the response.

Comprehensive Response Generation: The chatbot generates detailed and accurate responses by synthesizing the information contained in the retrieved documents, providing the user with contextually appropriate answers.

Project Workflow
Document Loading: The project first retrieves documents, including PDFs from a provided source and online documents via web scraping. This allows the system to have a rich knowledge base from which to extract information.

Document Processing: The loaded documents are split into smaller chunks to ensure efficient processing and to maintain context when analyzing text. These chunks are stored for retrieval when relevant queries are made.

Embedding and Vector Store Creation: Each chunk of text is transformed into vector embeddings. These embeddings are stored in a vector database, enabling fast and efficient document retrieval based on similarity to the user's query.

Query Handling: When a user submits a query, the system first classifies the query based on its topic. It then retrieves relevant documents either from the local vector store or through a web search.

Relevance Evaluation: Retrieved documents are evaluated to determine their relevance to the query, ensuring that the final response is both accurate and useful.

Response Generation: Based on the retrieved documents, the system generates a comprehensive response that directly addresses the userâ€™s query. The response is based solely on the information contained in the documents, ensuring factual accuracy.

User Interface: A simple user interface allows users to input their queries and receive both the chatbot's generated response and any supporting documents that were used in forming the answer.

How to Use
Running the Notebook: Simply open the Jupyter notebook and run all the cells in sequence. The notebook will load the necessary documents, create the vector store, and prepare the chatbot for interaction.

Inputting Queries: You can input any query related to natural language processing, computer science, or general knowledge into the chatbot interface provided within the notebook. The chatbot will retrieve relevant information and generate a detailed response based on the retrieved documents.

Viewing Responses: After processing the query, the chatbot will provide a detailed response. Additionally, any relevant documents that contributed to the response will be displayed to give further context.

Example Queries
Natural Language Processing Queries:

"What is word embedding?"
"Explain the architecture of Unet."
General Knowledge Queries:

"How do tennis players perform their exercises?"
"Tell me about the history of the Internet."
Project Capabilities
Advanced Retrieval: The chatbot can retrieve information both from locally stored documents (such as PDFs) and web sources, ensuring that responses are accurate and up-to-date.

Contextual Responses: By leveraging document embeddings and relevance classification, the chatbot can generate responses that are highly relevant to the user's query, with clear and comprehensive answers.

Efficient Document Handling: The system efficiently handles large documents by breaking them into smaller chunks, ensuring that even large datasets can be processed and retrieved from in a timely manner.

Potential Improvements
Additional Document Sources: The system could be extended to include more diverse sources of information, such as online databases, APIs, or other repositories of knowledge.

Interactive Learning: Future versions of the chatbot could include features that allow it to learn from user interactions and refine its responses over time, improving the chatbot's accuracy and relevance.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot, designed to handle a wide variety of queries using a combination of document retrieval, machine learning, and natural language processing techniques. By combining document retrieval from both local sources and the web, and integrating a large language model for response generation, the chatbot is capable of providing detailed and contextually appropriate responses to a wide range of queries.
